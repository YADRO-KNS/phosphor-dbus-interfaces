    Implement to provide the boot initiator (such as Petitboot or UEFI)
    with its specific parameters. This is based on IPMI 2.0 Table 28-14
    'Boot Option Parameters' parameter 7 'Boot initiator mailbox'.

properties:
    - name: Supported
      type: boolean
      default: false
      flags:
        - const
      description: >
          Specifies whether or not the mailbox is supported by the
          boot initiator on this machine.

    - name: IANAEnterpriseNumber
      type: uint32
      default: 0
      flags:
        - const
      description: >
          The 24-bit IANA Private Enterprise Number for the company or organization
          that has specified the boot initiator. This is a machine-specific
          constant. The implementing application is responsible for setting
          this to the proper machine-specific value (0x000000..0xFFFFFF)
          according to https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers

    - name: DataSize
      type: uint32
      default: 80
      flags:
        - const
      description: >
          Size of the Data property in bytes. This is a machine-specific
          constant. The implementing application is responsible for setting
          this to the proper machine-specific value.

          For conformance to the IPMI 2.0 specification, this value plus 3
          (the size of IPMI 2.0 representation of IANA Enterprise Number)
          must be a multiple of 16 with the minimum allowed value being 77
          (5 x 16-byte blocks, minus 3) if mailbox is at all Supported.

    - name: Data
      type: array[byte]
      default: 0
      description: >
          The array of data bytes for the boot initiator to treat
          in its specific way. This interface doesn't impose any
          limitiations on the format or make any assumptions regarding
          it. The boot initiator is responsible for parsing this array.

          For IPMI 2.0 this array is supposed to be split into 16-byte
          blocks by the implementing service (block 0 being made of IANA PEN
          plus first 13 bytes of this array). Please pay special attention
          that this array does NOT include the IANA PEN needed for IPMI 2.0.
          Only the actual PEN-specific data is stored here.

          When partially written to, the remaining parts of this array
          must not be automatically cleared. This is per IPMI 2.0
          specification.

          Other interfaces to the boot initiator (such as MCTP) may process
          this array differently.
